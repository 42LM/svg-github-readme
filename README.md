svg-github-readme provides a simple solution of creating custom SVG[^1] text (e.g. headings, eye-catching content ...) in your github readme file.

ðŸš§ This is work in progress ðŸš§, currently the only thing that is possible to do is getting an svg with animated text as in this example:
```md
![](https://svg-github-readme.vercel.app/api?text=Hello,%20World!)
```
